3. seeding:- ðŸŒ± What is Seeding in Databases?
    :- for seeding we have to create a new prisma client separately https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/prisma-migrate/workflows/seeding
    :- we have to put a script to package.json file to run 
    "prisma": {
        "seed": "ts-node -r tsconfig-paths/register --compiler-options {\"module\":\"CommonJS\"} prisma/seed/seed.ts"
    } // ask GPT why this is best over the script by prisma doc. [-r:equire the module before running the script. , tsconfig-paths/register: this will help working with this imports @/,  --compiler-options {"module":"CommonJS"}:  ]

:- Seeding in the context of databases means inserting initial or sample data into your tables.
Itâ€™s like planting seeds in a garden to grow data that you can use for development, testing, or even production.

For example, if you have tables for car makes, models, and variants, you might seed them with data like this:
* Makes: Toyota, Honda, Ford
* Models: Corolla, Civic, Mustang
* Variants: LE, SE, GT
This helps to quickly populate the database with essential data, so you donâ€™t have to add it manually every time you reset or migrate your database.

----------------------------------classes
____antialiased: The antialiased class smooths text rendering, making fonts appear softer and more readable, especially on low-resolution screens.
üîπ Example Usage
Better Readability for Blog Text
<p className="antialiased text-gray-700">
  This paragraph will have smoother font rendering.
</p>

üîÑ antialiased vs. subpixel-antialiased
Class	Effect	When to Use?
antialiased	Soft, thin text	When you want smoother fonts, especially on macOS.
subpixel-antialiased	Thicker, sharper text	If you need high-contrast text (e.g., on bright backgrounds).



____inset-0: The class inset-0 is a shorthand for setting all four positional properties (top, right, bottom, and left) to 0.
This makes the element stick to all four edges of its closest positioned ancestor (relative, absolute, or fixed container).

Usage Examples
1Ô∏è‚É£ Full Covering an Absolute Element
<div className="relative w-64 h-64 bg-gray-200">
  <div className="absolute inset-0 bg-black opacity-50"></div>
</div>
üîπ The inner div (absolute inset-0) will cover the entire parent because it stretches to all sides.

____line-clamp-1: The line-clamp-N class limits text to a specified number of lines and adds an ellipsis (...) if the text overflows.

When & Why to Use?
line-clamp-1	1 line	Use when you always want text to stay on one line (e.g., titles, buttons, links)
line-clamp-2	2 lines	Use when a short description is needed (e.g., card subtitles, post previews)
line-clamp-1 / line-clamp-2 = Limit text overflow


____flex-1: The flex-1 class makes an element expand and take up all available space inside a flex container.

When & Why to Use?
Class	Effect	Use Case
flex-1	Fills remaining space	Used inside flex containers to distribute space evenly
flex-auto	Grows as needed	Used when you don‚Äôt want shrinking
flex-1 = Make an element take up remaining space

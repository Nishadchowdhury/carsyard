     * 1. classified Classified — What Does This Mean?
     * classified (first part): The name of the field in your model that represents this relation. You’ll use this in queries.
     * Classified (second part): The name of the related model (table) in your database schema.
     * In simple words:
     * It means this model has a connection to the Classified table and you’ll access it using the field classified.

     * 2. @relation(fields: [classifiedId], references: [id]) — What Does This Do?
     * fields: [classifiedId]:
     * Specifies the foreign key in the current/this table that stores the ID of the related Classified table.
     * references: [id]:
     * Specifies that the classifiedId points to the id column in the Classified table.
     * In simple words:
     * There is a column called classifiedId in the current/this table.
     * This column stores the ID of a row from the Classified table.
     * It creates a foreign key constraint linking these tables.

    /**
     * 3. onDelete: Cascade — What Does This Do?
     * onDelete: Cascade means if a row in the Classified table is deleted, all related rows in the current table will automatically be deleted too.
     * Example:
     * If you delete a car listing from the Classified table, all related images, offers, or other linked data will be deleted as well.
     * This helps keep the database clean and prevents orphaned records.
